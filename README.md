# Emotion-Recognition
This repository deals with the recognition of emotions by extracting the facial expressions. I used Convolutional Neural Network for the same using the tflearn library of the tensorflow. In total, I detected seven degrees of emotions: Angry, Disgusted, Happy, Fearful, Neutral, Sad and Surprised.
My model achived an accuracy of 75% using the <a href="http://www.socsci.ru.nl:8180/RaFD2/RaFD?p=main"> FER 2013 Dataset.</a>
